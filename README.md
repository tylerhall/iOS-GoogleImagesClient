iOS-GoogleImagesClient
======================

I often find myself wanting to search Google for an image on my iDevice so I can save it to my camera roll and do something with it. Going to the web to do this is slow and painful. This app lets you quickly search Google Images and save whatever you find. Tap an image to load it full screen. Long press on the fullsize image to save to your camera roll.

The app uses the deprecated [Google Images JSON API](https://developers.google.com/image-search/). I have no idea how long it will continue working.

Be gentle. I wrote this code in about an hour one evening after two glasses of scotch while listening to a baseball game.

Feel free to download the source and make improvements. You'll need to `pod install` before running.
